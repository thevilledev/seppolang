# SeppoLang

A minimalist programming language where everything is _seppo_.

## Overview

SeppoLang is an experimental programming language that uses the keyword 'seppo' for various operations. It features:

- Print statements using `seppo`
- Conditional blocks with `seppo` and `perkele` (else)
- Seamless C integration with `ceppo` blocks

## Building

Requires:
- Rust toolchain
- LLVM

## Why?

I wanted to learn more about compilers and programming languages. More specifically, LLVM and Rust.
